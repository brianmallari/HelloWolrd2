This "Hello World" repository is for practice based off of the book GitHub for Dummies

# Some Info About Me
Hi, my name is Brian. I graduated in May of 2019 from Rutgers University with master's degree focusing on data science. This repository is meant to serve as practice so that I can later on use GitHub to showcase not only some of my work from graduate school but also any data science/machine learning content that I may create later on.
